This branch is for integration of Style Editor add-on into the browser.


The feature is disabled by default.

To enable pref 'devtools.style_editor.enabled' must be set to 'true'.



Helpers for migration to add-on to browser :

`./rebase.sh => ./migrate.sh => ./update.sh => commit`

(fix up if needed between steps)
